<!-- Plugin description -->
**Fish Language Support** is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs that adds support
for the [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/) language. Currently only syntax highlighting and bare
error checking is supported. A couple of features are planned for the future, but I'm not sure
when I'll get around to implementing them.
It does however has some nice to have features like:

- Annotating Environment Variables, including in strings
- Annotating hex, unicode and character escapes such as: `\x00`, `\u0000` and `\cA`
